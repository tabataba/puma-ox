How to compile the postprocessor
================================
The postprocessor is a C++ program requiring the NetCDF C++ library

The makefile is configured to look for:

1) The include file "netcdfcpp.h" in directory /opt/local/include
2) The library file "libnetcdf_c++.*" in directory /opt/local/lib

If doing "make" produces errors, locate these files and adjust
the I-path and the L-path in the makefile accordingly.

If you don't find the netcdfcpp.h file, you may want to install the
netcdf package or ask your administrator to do it.

After successfull compilation copy the executable "burn7.x" to a 
directory in your PATH. Administrators may choose
/opt/local/bin or /usr/local/bin.
Users may just copy it to $HOME/bin and make sure, that the 
PATH variable includes $HOME/bin.

The burn7 is backward compatible and can process data files
produced with older versions of PUMA or PLASIM.
PUMA and PLASIM version 16 however require burn7.

New features and changes
========================
Burn7 now uses the C++ version of the NetCDF library.
It uses less memory and runs faster than Burn6.
It has a better compatibility to the CF and NetCDF standard.

How to use the postprocessor
============================
Look into the PUMA or PLaSim User's Guide (chapter postprocessor).
A quick reference card can be found in this directory in file "burn7qr.pdf".

More diagnostic software and tools
==================================
It is strongly recommended to install following free software:

NetCDF - common data format
cdo - climate data operators
grads - graphics software
ImageMagick - graphics software & tools

For MAC users:
==============
Use "port" for easy installation. If you don't have port,
download it from "www.macports.org" and install it.
Installing is then as easy as:

sudo port install netcdf
sudo port install cdo

etc.

Good Luck
